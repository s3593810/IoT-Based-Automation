This project utilizes Raspberry Pi Model B
Along with Sensehat to sense the environment arround it. 

Coding used for this task is Python. 
It tests humidity and temperature around every hour and logs to a database.
There is a Json file to check the minimum and maximum temperature and humidity if the sensed temperature and humidity higher or lower than the 
assigned minimum and maximum values the sourrounding bluetooth and other devices gets pushbullet notifications.

At the end the collected data in the database get visualized to represent the changes in humidity and temperature using python visualization
libraries.
