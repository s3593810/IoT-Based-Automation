SenseEnvironment 

This file calls for raspberry to get the data for humidity and temerature. 
The temperature of the environment gets caliberated using a function which first gets the sensed temperature along with the heat of the cpu.
Later on delating or subtracting the tmeperature of the cpu helps getting the temperature value closer to the actual sourrounding temperature.
