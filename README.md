This branch works on visualization of data using python libraries.
The sensehat data is saved in the data base. This branch reads the data from the database
formats it into date, temperature and humidity and represents the changes in the temperature and humidity by days.

Two libraries are used to visualize the data. 
Matplotlib and sesborn library. 

Matplotlib: 
Matplotlib is a 2-D plotting visualizing library. It emulates matlab like graphs and visualizations.
Matplot library has robust plotting capacity. It is really good at representing data directly from database or csv files. 
It can represent differnt plots on the same figure using subplotting mechanism which is really helpful to present robust 
information in one picture. However it is only possilbe to represent 6 subplots in a figure using this library.


Seaborn Library: 
Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library. Although it stands on top of matplot library but it is good at 
representing statistical graphics in python. It is a dataset oriented api good at presenting relationships between multiple variables.
