Connect with your Phone
AFter rebooting to make sure all changes have taken effect, you should be able to connect your phone to the Raspberry Pi via bluetooth. Note, the following instructions are based on a Nexus 4 running Android 4.4.2.

Turn off the phone's Wifi. The phone will not connect to a bluetooth NAP network if wireless is available.

Start the pinaple agent on the Raspberry Pi. You may specify a pairing PIN code, or use the default of "0000".

sudo pinaple-agent --pin 1234

This will make the Raspberry Pi discoverable by your phone, and will accept the PIN code and trust the device. After pairing, press ctrl-C to end the agent and make the Raspberry Pi undiscoverable again. You will only need to perform this step once for each device, or until you un-pair the phone.

Turn Bluetooth on on the phone, and search for devices. Select the raspberrypi-0 and pair to it, with the pin code you specified when starting pinaple-agent.

Click the 'settings' icon next to the raspberrypi-0, then click to check the 'Internet access' check box. If all goes well, after several seconds you should see a small '3G' appear above the 'bars' icon of the phone's status bar.

You are now connected to the Raspberry Pi's network via Bluetooth.
